<h4>Dear Prof. {prof_name}</h4>
<p>I hope you are doing well and are in good health.</p>
<p>I am a senior biology major at the University of Notre Dame. I am applying to the CMB
    program and am very interested in your work. After glancing at a few of your recent
    papers and your research summary I find your work with apoptosis very interesting. Will
    you be taking on new students next year? If I am invited to interview, is there any way
    you will be able to meet with me? </p>
<p>I have worked on several research projects as an undergraduate in Dr. David R.
    Hyde's lab at the University of Notre Dame. The Hyde lab is interested in the signals that
    initiate Muller glia division post-light damage. My first research project was
    characterizing the role of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in the activation of cell
    proliferation in the undamaged zebrafish retina. I am also working on several
    experiments that are related to a genetic screen that the Hyde lab plans on performing to
    identify mutants in the regeneration pathway--I am developing a neuroD4:EGFP
    transgenic line for use in this screen and I am characterizing the extent of damage and
    regeneration in sheer zebrafish retinas. Finally, I am characterizing the chx10:EGFP
    transgenic line during retinal development and regeneration.</p>
<p>Please find my CV attached.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, </p>
<h4>Sincerely,</h4>
