        <h4>Dear Prof. {name},</h4>
        <p>I hope you are doing healthy during this pandemic.
            I am Danial Ebrat and I have completed my <b>M.Sc. Computer Science</b>
            in Data Mining at <b>Polytechnic of Tehran (Amirkabir University of Technology)</b>.
            I am considering applying to the {uni}'s Ph.D. program and it would be an honor
            to join your research group{group}.</p>


        <p>I&apos;m extremely engrossed in <b>interdisciplinary</b> researches related to <b>Deep Learning,
            Machine learning</b>, and <b>AI</b>. My personal research, generally lie in the intersection
            of Music (Also poems & lyrics) and artificial intelligence. I enjoy connecting none musician people to music with a better perspective by creating
            Deep learning models based on Music, Audio, and speech processing (like creating a melody generator based on the first few user-defined notes).
            My master&apos;s thesis was <b>&quot;Persian Modal Music (Dastgah) Detection&quot;</b>
            which uses <b>autoencoder</b> architecture including BiLSTM and BiGRU networks.
            I defended my thesis two months ago, the abstract can be found <b><a href="https://danialebrat.com/#resume">here</a></b>,
            and currently, I'm writing the article to publish at the ISMIR2022. Moreover,
            I&apos;m interested in expanding my researches by connecting AI music and Deep learning to
            various fields in <b>human health</b> such as <b>psychology, Medical (Bio / Images), Biology,
            and Neuroscience</b> especially associated with kids.</p>

            <p>Besides my researches, I&apos;m working as an <b>Artificial intelligence specialist</b> at a high-tech company in Iran.
            I&apos;m a member of the <b>research and development</b> group and we mainly focus on cutting-edge problems in AI systems
            using deep learning, machine learning, and data Mining which are mostly interdisciplinary projects due to our
            divergent clients. Currently, I'm leading two large-scale projects related to the aerospace industry where I am developing cutting-edge
            approaches to detect anomalies in time series data and predict their future behavior. Moreover, I am contributing
            to other projects to connect AI to Audio sounds (denoising, source separation, audio inpainting, classifying background, and identifying speakers),
            graph databases (using Apache Spark, Cassandra, Livy, Neo4J, and SCALA programming to handle user's requests), and
            the agriculture and livestock industry (supply chain network). I code in <b>Python</b> mostly for preprocessing, data analyzing, data mining, data visualization,
            and of course, creating and developing deep learning and machine learning models. Also, I&apos;m participating in other projects
            which are using <b>MATLAB</b> and <b>SCALA</b>. Furthermore, my resume and additional information about me are
            easily accessible on <b><a href="https://danialebrat.com">my website</a></b> and we can talk about my projects
            (work and academic) more in detail, if you are interested.</p>


        <p>I wonder if you would be so kind as to read my CV (which is available <b><a href="https://danialebrat.com/#resume">here</a></b>,
            also attached) and let me know if it could be acceptable to pursue my education towards a Ph.D. degree under your supervision.</p>


        <p>I look very much forward to hearing back from you. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.</p>

        <h4>Sincerely,</h4>
